        Plain flow scalars are picky about the (:) and (#) characters. 
        They can be in the string, but (:) cannot appear before a space or newline.
        And (#) cannot appear after a space or newline; doing this will cause a syntax error. 
        If you need to use these characters you are probably better off using one of the quoted styles instead.
